There were some books left to scan, so I completed that in the morning.
It was the fun books, way at the end of the shelf, that nobody seemed to have touched in a long time.

Then I wanted to have a look at the data collected.
Someone in the new batch, [Saul](http://www.pwanson.com/), created a tool that seemed perfect fit for this.
[visidata](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata) is a [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) spreadsheet tool with the goal to be extendable to various data formats and workflows.

Installation went pretty smoothly (with some help of the project creator) although I my data was in a format not yet supported by visidata (vd), namely [`jsonl`](jsonlines.org). The histogram feature of vd is pretty cool! We found out, that [Addison-Wesley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addison-Wesley) was the most prominent publisher, which is a good sign for a programmer's bookshelf, I guess.

I did put some thoughts into how to publish the data in the same pragmatic way as I acquired it, but did not yet come to a conclusion. I rather signed up for a Thursday presentation and prepared that. As always most of the ideas for the talk came very close before I actually had to speak. I tried to share my insights on im-perfection, so what I had learned the day before, combined with showing the data I had collected. It was fun.

In the evening there was a game night. I played one game of [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)), which was fun, and then was hooked up by a poker round. At first it seemed we could not get enough players to create a fun round, but then we started with five players and some more joined later. I lost my money before I even considered leaving the table. Later I dealt cards, which I enjoyed. I was very opinionated though, which I regret. I interferred with some hands, which I shouldn't have done for the sake of fairness. I would like to know about some "best practices" for poker dealers. Maybe [this](http://truepokerdealer.com/index.html) will do.

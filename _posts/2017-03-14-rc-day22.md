There was major snow announced, so the MTA (Metropolitan Transport Authority) announced that it would be a good idea to stay home. So I did, an in fact there were not many buses coming by during the day.

This weekend, inspired by others, I decided to share everything that I am working on at RC. I started putting my stuff in repositories and pushing them to Github. Today I pushed some reading notes of the [two](https://github.com/zormit/reading-7L7W) [books](https://github.com/zormit/reading-ctm) that I'm reading, tomorrow more will come. I have to commit and organize all the files, that why it takes a while.

Then I played some [wargame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame_(hacking)), which is some kind of computer security related exercise. First it took me a while to find it again -- I had a specific one in mind that I had tried two weeks earlier. It was [OverTheWire/Bandit](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit), a very basic one which might not even deserve the name wargame, as the content there isn't security related. It was training some GNU bash command-line tools, I took it as an opportunity to learn more about [GNU find](https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/).

I am planning to prepare a presentation on `find` and things that can go wrong on Thursday. If everything goes according to plan, I should prepare it by tomorrow night. I would also like to try out my cheatsheet idea. If I've not prepared it by tomorrow, it won't happen on Thursday -- that's the deal (with myself).

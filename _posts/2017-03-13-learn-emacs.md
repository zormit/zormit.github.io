One of the [first things I learned at RC]({% post_url 2017-02-14-rc-day2 %}) was how to use the [Emacs](http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Emacs) [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war#Humor). Besides being good for lame jokes, Emacs is a text editor which is intended to be used with the keyboard only. There are features like moving between words, sentences and paragraphs with a low number of keystrokes.

I'm not saying you should *use* Emacs as your new editor, in fact continue with your favourite tool (Tip 22 from [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://blog.codinghorror.com/a-pragmatic-quick-reference/): "Use a Single Editor Well"), but I recommend taking a couple of hours, say one, as a start, to pick up some hotkeys and the concepts of how it works.

Why? Because it will allow you to be more flexible regarding the tools you're using. I am talking mostly about command-line tools in a Bash-like environment on the GNU/Linux operating system. Let me give you some examples from my experience:

* I was able to pair with someone who was using Emacs and I could actually use the editor on [their computer](https://xkcd.com/1806/) without being scared to break something. And I could save the file with the correct keystrokes (*yay*, as unfortunately it's not &lt;Cmd&gt;+S).

* I am learning to navigate the command-line more efficiently. When I am typing a command, I can now remember how to jump to beginning and end, jump between words, how to correct typos without deleting everything or moving very slowly with the arrows. Sometimes I look it up on the Emacs tutorial.

* My commute to RC includes a 50 minute bus ride, so there's plenty of time to kill. Recently I wanted to look at some documentation for [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog), but I had no internet available. Oh no, what do you do? I started browsing the [manpage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page) which directed me to the [`info`](https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/) tool. I had no idea how to navigate through the pages etc, but when I looked at the help it looked very familiar to the commands I had picked up for Emacs.

That is actually no surprise, as GNU Emacs and GNU Bash and GNU info all have a common ground: GNU. So, although this stuff is not very easy to pick up, it gives you a better leverage in the long term towards using a large variety of tools. A good place to go now might be [here](http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/04/emacs-beginner-resources/).
